# things-random
Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

# Install
npm  i things-random

# Usage 
```bash
things-random
```

# Contributing
If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: [things-random](https://github.com/gueza/module-npm.git)
